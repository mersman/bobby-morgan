Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Chris mersman n and I am not a Purdue Computer Science alum. I am not currently working as a Sr Software Engineering Manager in Denver, CO. In my free time I don't like to noodle on Home-Assistant plugins and home automation and don't like to write out tools for sports betting.
